## ðŸ”ƒWorking of project

- application.properties

        - Here we have wrote workbence connectivity details.

- Application

        - Here where the application starts running.
        - Once compiled we  will get the port number like(8080) where we can use it to do CRUD operations.

- Todo, AppUser

        - I have created this for model which should be same as the column in the database.

- Todo Repository, User Repository

        - Here i have written the code to play with the database.

- Todo Controller, User Controller

        - Have where the business logic takes place.
        - We would have used annotations here which has been described below.

- Todo Service, User Service

        - Here we will get the object for the Repository class and we will perform CRUD operations.
## Annotations used

        @SpringBootApplication
        @Override
        @CrossOrigin
        @Repository
        @Service
        @Autowired
        @RestController
        @RequestMapping
        @GetMapping
        @PostMapping
        @PutMapping
        @DeleteMapping
        @Entity
        @Getter
        @Setter
        @NoArgsConstructor
        @AllArgsConstructor
        @Table
        @Id
        @GeneratedValue
